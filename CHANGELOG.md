# Change log for HMLR apps feature tests

## 2019-11-19

- switched default browser to Firefox, as Chromium on
  Ubuntu 19.10 gives an error when starting with Selenium
- switched browser driver library from `chromedriver` to
  `webdrivers`
- set rbenv Ruby version to 2.4.9 to match current deployment
  environment
